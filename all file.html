<h2>. 5 .Pushpa: The Rise - Part 1 </h2>
<p id="er">Pushpa: The Rise – Part 01 (simply known as Pushpa: The Rise) is a 2021 Indian Telugu-language action drama film[17] written and directed by Sukumar.

Filming resumed in November 2020 and ended in November 2021, predominantly taking place at the Ramoji Film City in Hyderabad and Maredumilli forest in Andhra Pradesh.
    
    Pushpa: The Rise was released on 17 December 2021 in Telugu along with dubbed versions in Malayalam, Tamil, Kannada, and Hindi languages. The film received generally mixed to positive reviews from critics, who praised the performances (particularly of Allu Arjun, Sunil and Fahadh Faasil), action choreography, cinematography, direction, dialogues, and soundtrack but criticised the runtime, writing, and editing.[18][19][20][21][22] The film was commercially successful, grossing ₹350 crore (US$44 million)-₹373 crore (US$47 million) at the box office. It became the highest-grossing Indian film of 2021, and ranks among the highest-grossing Telugu films of all time.[23]
